##### Abstract

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have ballooned throughout the developing world in recent decades, providing services previously relegated to the government. When NGOs enter the market and crowd out government institutions, what happens to public funds that are displaced? Do NGOs extend the work of government, or is it corrupted? Using 12 years of municipal budget data from the Philippines, this project estimates corruption through anomaly detection and links it to the subnational distribution of NGO spending.
