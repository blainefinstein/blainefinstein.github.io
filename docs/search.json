My research focuses on the political economy of development, public resource allocation, and applications of computational tools to social science. I am also a consultant for Identification for Development at the World Bank, where I manage a research agenda to study the impacts of PhilSys, the Philippines’ foundational national ID system.\nPrior to the PhD, I worked in a number of roles spanning foreign aid policy and practice. I supported refugee resettlement operations at the International Rescue Committee and served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Philippines, where I developed remedial reading programming in Roxas City, Western Visayas."

Examples include corruption, repression, and vote buying. This presents a fundamental inference problem: observed labels are one-sided (positive-only), non-observation is uninformative, the relational structure contains information about the latent trait, and conventional supervised and unsupervised methods fail. Standard supervised learning introduces bias when labelled data are non-random, and unsupervised learning cannot anchor latent features to substantively meaningful characteristics.\nI introduce a general framework for latent variable measurement under asymmetric label noise in relational data. I propose a two-layer measurement model with three components: (1) unsupervised relational embedding to capture systematic structure induced by the latent trait in the network, (2) latent variable mapping from embeddings to latent trait probability, and (3) an observation model that assumes detection is determined by a biased process conditional on the latent trait. I show that a joint relational-detection model recovers latent traits more accurately than standard supervised and unsupervised approaches under asymmetric observability. I do so by simulating networks where a latent trait affects tie formation and detection depends on covariates to compare supervised classifiers, unsupervised embeddings, and my proposed estimator. I then apply the method to a 25-year panel of municipal public procurement in the Philippines, a case where corruption shapes contracting but detection is determined politically.\n\n\nSweetening the Deal: Colonial sugar cultivation and the historical roots of elite capture\nCoauthors: Jose Gloria (ULCA)\nThis paper argues that agricultural endowments shaped local financial networks and created enduring opportunities for elite capture. In the Philippines, sugar mills served as economic chokepoints that tied farmers’ livelihoods to local landed elites. This dependence fostered durable patron–client relationships that helped consolidate political and economic power over time. These historical dependencies produced more centralized elite networks in sugar-growing regions, compared to the more fragmented structures found elsewhere. The study combines historical data on sugar mills with municipal-level electoral networks, linking political clans through shared family names. Preliminary results show that municipalities historically organized around sugar chokepoints are more likely to capture disaster aid during crises, suggesting that entrenched elite coordination continues to shape the distribution of public resources in the present day. The analysis uses network measures of centralization and modularity, supported by econometric strategies that leverage variation in exposure to structural and programmatic shocks."
