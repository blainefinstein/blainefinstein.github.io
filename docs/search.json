My research focuses on the political economy of development, public resource allocation, and applications of computational tools to social science. I am also a consultant for Identification for Development at the World Bank, where I manage a research agenda to study the impacts of PhilSys, the Philippines’ foundational national ID system.\nPrior to the PhD, I worked in a number of roles spanning aid research and practice. I supported refugee resettlement operations at the International Rescue Committee and served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Philippines, where I developed remedial reading programming in Roxas City, Western Visayas. I am also the recipient of a Fulbright research grant at Ateneo de Manila University.\nI hold an MA in political science from UCLA and a BA in international relations and Plan II Honors from UT Austin."

In a natural experiment leveraging conscription for a 1920s Peruvian highway designed to replicate a pre-colonial road system (Qhapaq Ñan), Carter finds through a geographic regression discontinuity design that eligibility for state conscription increased the likelihood of a municipality having an indigenous movement by about 30 percentage points (approximately .75 standard deviations) and scores on an omnibus accommodation measure by about .3 items (approximately .4 standard deviations). The omnibus measure includes the number of institutions that an indigenous community reports preserving (increased by .3 items on a 7 point scale, or .25 standard deviations), likelihood of having a communal land title (increased by 12 percentage points, or .3 standard deviations), and likelihood of registration with the government (increased by 9 percentage points, or .3 standard deviations). All point estimates are significant at the .1% level.\nWe successfully computationally reproduce all main claims of the paper but find inconsistencies between the map of the road presented by Carter and that used by Franco et al. (2021) that affect its passage through a small number of municipalities. In order to investigate whether these municipalities drive the main findings without the ability to identify municipalities in the data, we drop municipalities iteratively and re-run the analysis, finding only minor changes in coefficient estimates across subsets. In addition, we explore a number of sensitivity analyses for the regression discontinuity design that vary the functional form, vary the bandwidth window, and use the Rosenbaum method for window selection. While the results remain consistent under all analyses, we recommend for further research to recode treated municipalities on the basis of the alternative road map and explore the as-if random assumption in light of evidence linking proximity to the precolonial road to various economic and political outcomes.\n\nSuggested citation\nFinstein, Blaine; Ash, Konstantin; Carnahan, Daniel (2024) : A Comment on “Extraction, Assimilation, and Accommodation: The Historical Foundations of Indigenous-State Relations in Latin America”, I4R Discussion Paper Series, No. 176, Institute for Replication (I4R), s.l.\nPaper\nDownload PDF"
